# Predicting Bike Rentals

## Introduction

Communal bike sharing serves have been implemented in many American cities. As a such service provider, we would like to know what factors may impact the total bike rentals and predicting how much profit we can make for given circumstances. This project implement ML algorithm to predict total bike rentals and distinct major factors that contribute to the result.

The data set will be using is from [Hadi Fanaee-T](https://folk.uio.no/hadift/) at the [University of Porto](http://www.up.pt/). This data set contains bike rental information at Washington, D.C. The csv file can be downloaded [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) from the University of California, Irvine's website.

* yr - The year the rentals occurred
* mnth - The month the rentals occurred

* weekday - The day of the week (as a number, 0 to 7)
* workingday - Whether or not the day was a working day
* weathersit - The weather (as a categorical variable)
* temp - The temperature, on a 0-1 scale
* atemp - The adjusted temperature
* hum - The humidity, on a 0-1 scale
* windspeed - The wind speed, on a 0-1 scale
* casual - The number of casual riders (people who hadn't previously signed up * with the bike sharing program)
* registered - The number of registered riders (people who had already signed up)
